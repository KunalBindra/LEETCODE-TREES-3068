# LEETCODE-TREES-3068
Let's perform a dry run of the `maximumValueSum` method in the given `Solution` class. We will go through the method step-by-step with an example to understand its behavior.

### Method Explanation

The `maximumValueSum` method takes the following parameters:
- `int[] nums`: An array of integers.
- `int k`: An integer used for bitwise XOR operations.
- `int[][] edges`: An array of edges, which is not used in the current implementation.

The method aims to compute the maximum sum of modified values from `nums`, where each value can either stay the same or be XORed with `k`. The decision on whether to XOR a value or not is made based on maximizing the sum. If an odd number of values are changed, the method adjusts the sum to ensure the result remains optimal.

### Step-by-Step Dry Run

#### Example
Let's take an example:
- `nums = {1, 2, 3}`
- `k = 2`

#### Initialization
- `maxSum = 0`: This will store the maximum possible sum.
- `changedCount = 0`: This will count how many numbers were changed (i.e., XORed with `k`).
- `minChangeDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE`: This will store the minimum difference between the original and XORed value.

#### Iteration through `nums`

**First iteration (num = 1):**
- Calculate `num ^ k`: `1 ^ 2 = 3`.
- Compare `num` and `num ^ k`: `Math.max(1, 3) = 3`.
- Add the maximum to `maxSum`: `maxSum = 0 + 3 = 3`.
- Determine if the number was changed: `(3 > 1)` is `true`, so increment `changedCount`: `changedCount = 0 + 1 = 1`.
- Calculate the absolute difference: `Math.abs(1 - 3) = 2`.
- Update `minChangeDiff`: `minChangeDiff = Math.min(Integer.MAX_VALUE, 2) = 2`.

**Second iteration (num = 2):**
- Calculate `num ^ k`: `2 ^ 2 = 0`.
- Compare `num` and `num ^ k`: `Math.max(2, 0) = 2`.
- Add the maximum to `maxSum`: `maxSum = 3 + 2 = 5`.
- Determine if the number was changed: `(0 > 2)` is `false`, so `changedCount` remains `1`.
- Calculate the absolute difference: `Math.abs(2 - 0) = 2`.
- Update `minChangeDiff`: `minChangeDiff = Math.min(2, 2) = 2`.

**Third iteration (num = 3):**
- Calculate `num ^ k`: `3 ^ 2 = 1`.
- Compare `num` and `num ^ k`: `Math.max(3, 1) = 3`.
- Add the maximum to `maxSum`: `maxSum = 5 + 3 = 8`.
- Determine if the number was changed: `(1 > 3)` is `false`, so `changedCount` remains `1`.
- Calculate the absolute difference: `Math.abs(3 - 1) = 2`.
- Update `minChangeDiff`: `minChangeDiff = Math.min(2, 2) = 2`.

#### Post-Iteration Adjustment
- Check if `changedCount` is even: `1 % 2 == 0` is `false`.
- Adjust `maxSum`: `maxSum = 8 - 2 = 6`.

### Final Output
The method returns `maxSum`, which is `6`.

### Summary

The dry run illustrates how the method calculates the maximum sum by potentially XORing each element with `k` and then adjusts the sum if an odd number of elements were changed. This ensures that the final sum is optimal by accounting for the smallest possible adjustment when necessary.
